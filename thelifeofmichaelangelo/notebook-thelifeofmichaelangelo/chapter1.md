痛苦是无穷的，它具有种种形式。有时，它是由于物质的凌虐，如灾难，疾病，命运的褊枉，人类的恶意。有时，它即蕴藏在人的内心。在这种情境中的痛苦，是同样的可悯，同样的无可挽救；因为人不能自己选择他的人生，人既不要求生，也不要求成为他所成为的样子。

米开朗琪罗的痛苦，即是这后一种。他有力量，他生来便是为战斗为征服的人；而且他居然征服了，可是，他不要胜利。他所要的并不在此。

Suffering is infinite and assumes a multitude of forms.At one time it is caused by the blind tyranny of things--poverty, sickness, the injustice of Fate, or the wickedness of man.At another time it has its seat in one's very being.It is then no less pitiable nor less fatal.For the choice of our being was not ours:we asked neither to live nor to be what we are.

The latter form of suffering was the one which afflicted Michael Angelo.He had the strength--he had the rare good fortune to be fashioned for struggling and conquering.He conquered.But what?He had no desire for victory.That was not what he wanted.

我恨那怯懦的理想主义，它只教人不去注视人生的苦难和心灵的弱点。……世界上只有一种英雄主义：便是注视世界的真面目--并且爱世界。

Cowardly idealism, which diverts our eyes from the woes of life and the weaknesses of the soul, I abhor.....
**There is only one heroism in the world, to see the world as it is,and to love it.**

我们应当敢于正视痛苦，尊敬痛苦！欢乐固然值得颂赞，痛苦亦何尝不值得颂赞！这两位是姊妹，而且都是圣者。她们锻炼人类开展伟大的心魂。她们是力，是生，是神。凡是不能兼爱欢乐与痛苦的人，便是既不爱欢乐，亦不爱痛苦。凡能体味她们的，方懂得人生的价值和离开人生时的甜蜜。

Let us have the courage to look sorrow in the face and venerate it! Blessed be joy, but blessed also be sorrow! One is the sister to the other and both are saints! They are strength, they are life, the are God! **He who loves not both of them, loves neither the one nor the other. And he who has relished them knows the value of life and the sweetness of leaving it.**
